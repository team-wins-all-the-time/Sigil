1).As a user who is unfamiliar with sigils, the main page will include an informative introduction to sigils in order to inform users about the app. The app will also be user friendly will clear instructions to minimize confusion. 

2). As a user who has experience with sigils, the app will strive to enhance their experience by creating different sigils that are unique each time by using RNG. 

3). As a curious user, the app will feature different examples of sigils generated through our app to give them an idea of the variety of sigils our site produces. 

4). As a user who is dissatisfied with what sigils are being generated for me, I can look through the gallery and find previously created ones that fit my situation. 

5). As a user who likes color, I can select from several preset options depending on my mood/intent. 

6). As developers, we get to work as a team to create an algorithm that combines RNG and arrays of shapes to present a new experience every use. 

7). As developers, we want to provide a bug free experience for our users. We will achieve this through rigorous testing and debugging.

#Conflict Plan
1).When the team encounters conflict, take a step back and have each team member think about the problem separately. Then come together to discuss each members' approach on how they would tackle the situation. 

2).Two hour check in to touch base with team members. If members are falling behind according to our schedule, we will have a discussion during the check-ins to see what other members can do to help. 

3). If our team is unable to solve a conflict, we will get in touch with TAs or Nicholas to get their opinions or how to come up with a solution. 

===
#Communication Plan

1).All team members are available after 6pm through Slack and will be responsive to notifications. Bonnie teaches on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7-9 and will be available after. 

2).All team members will notify each other of changes and get approval from other teammates before making changes.

3).To ensure that everyone is getting a chance to speak up and to create a psychologically safe envioronment, the word "CAROL" will be used to notify a team member when they are being too overpowering or unwilling to be open to others' ideas.
