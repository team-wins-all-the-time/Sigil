        <p id="main">Sigils are powerful tools for meditation, asserting your intentions, and magick. They draw meaning from the intent and work you put into their creation. While there are as many ways to create sigils as there are sigil users, the basic principal is that you create a shape that takes on your intention as itâ€™s meaning. Then, whenever the sigil is used, activated, or seen that intention is called upon. Our generator draws inspiration from several main schools of sigil creation to create a new form. Type in a word or phrase that encapsulates your intent and use the result either as a finished sigil or as a template to embellish into one that works best for you.</p>

            <h3>Chaos Magick</h3>
            <img src="/img/chaos.JPG" alt="" id="img_one">
            <p>Chaos Magicians have popularized a method of sigil crafting based on the work of the artist Austin Osman Spare. In this widespread method, one takes a word or phrase and eliminates all of the vowels and duplicate letters. Then, one crafts the remaining letters into a cohesive symbol that becomes the sigil.  </p>

            <h3> Sigil Witchery</h3>

            <img src="/img/sigil3.png" alt="" id="img_two">

            <p>Sigil Witchery, for lack of a better name, is the very personal method of creating sigils detailed by Laura Tempest Zakroff in her book of the same title. This practice involves cultivating a personal symbolic library, fully understanding the problem you are trying to tackle, breaking it down in to component parts, and then applying those symbols to a design intended to connect to those components.  </p>

            <h3>Kamea Sigils</h3>
            <img src="/img/Kamea.JPG" alt="img_three">
            <p> Kamea sigils make use of the seven planetary squares. Once you have removed the vowels and repeat letters from your word/phrase,  you map the remaining based on alphabetical position to the square. After plotting the letters, you draw a small circle at the beginning, lines connecting the subsequent letters, and a small line at the final point. The resulting symbol is your sigil. </p>
