merry's paraphrased notes:  
Images are short hand - for those those who understand them. Like any language, one can glean lots of information from them very quickly. This is one of the benefits of symbols - and of sigils (22-23). 
context always impacts meaning - a single stroke will typically not be as impactful if it is isolated from the whole (23) 

potential quotes to pull from Temptest: 
"A Sigil is a carved, drawn, or painted symbol taht is believed to have magical properties or power." (pg. 17)
"While making accurately representational art may seem like it requires a lot of skill, it takes a deeper sense of creativity to see the world in non-representational terms." (pg. 21) 

ideas for our symbols from Tempest's text: 
        Cave paintings included cross-temporarily/contentinentally signs such as astrisk's, cruciform's (t,x), triangles, finger fluting, zigzags, spirals, quadrangles, handprints, ovals, scalariforms(ladderlike), penniforms(featherlike), circles, cordiforms(heartshape), serpentiforms(snakelike, wavylines), dots, half-circles, parallel lines, grids/hashing#
   from Aboriginal Art: chevron, chevron w/ center line, oppositional j's ovals, connected rings, concentric circles, U shapes,
